            &#183; I am a 14-year-old boy named Clim Maxim with blonde hair, green eyes, and a powerful physique born on the first of July 2009. Im in 8th grade and I study in Gaudeamus high school. I dont really put school as a very important thing in my life, because of that i am not stressed and i see life with a very positive view in my mind. The best part is that i still get good grades!

            &#183; My family consists of 5 members, me, my sister, my mother, my dad, and my dog. My sister practices dancing at Sis N Bro, and thanks to her I know a lot of girls. My mom is a personal trainer, without her I wouldn't have such a great body. My father is a designer, without him, I wouldn't have the knowledge I have today. My dog is a fluff ball and without her, I wouldn't be as happy as I am. I really couldn't have asked for a better family than the one that I have.

          &#183; I live in Moldova, Ciocana, and visited a lot of very beautiful countries with my family. It's a pleasure to see the other parts of the world and come home with memories that will forever live on in my heart. Every year our family goes to at least one new country, it's always something different and very memorable. Now we look at our old adventures and remember how much fun we had in the past. I truly love traveling.
