              &#183; Working Out - I've been training for 3 years now, almost 4, which has helped me be a lot healthier and gave me new goals to hit. Through training, I gained more respect from people around me and it has exponentially increased my level of confidence and self-esteem. I actively encourage my friends to work out, and I think the ones who listened, don't regret it at all. Now training has become a part of my daily life, and it shall remain like that for a long time.

              &#183; Kickboxing - For a long time I've wanted to do a martial art, but never could I decide what type I wanted to practice, because of my indecisiveness I never actually got to start. Recently I was reminded about this, it bugged me for a few weeks until I actually started kickboxing. I do think I will enjoy it, and maybe even become a master at it, you never know.

              &#183; Swimming - I started swimming lessons at the ripe age of 6 and did that for almost 6 years. I stopped because the setting and timing weren't that convenient. Well I'm bummed about not continuing it, I still am thankful for the developed ability to swim and the endurance it gave me. Maybe I will return to swimming in the future, it would be great to get back to it.

              &#183; Dancing - I first was introduced to Sis N Bro when my little sister Ariana really wanted to dance. As time went on, I got to meet members of her team, which drew me closer to her and the whole concept of dancing. Because Ariana's team members were girls, and I was an adolescent boy, I obviously wanted to take part in that. Quickly I understood being one boy in a full group of girls wouldn't really be an option, so I opted out of a group with boys in it. I made a lot of friends, and I do not regret trying to dance. I will most likely get back into dancing, but not now.

              &#183; Robotics/Coding - I've done my fair share of work with robots, I took part in summer programs, and more recently, completed a full-blown course with my friends where we built and programmed robots. We totally destroyed the other students there, because we were the only ones with a full 100% on every test given. I am very interested in programming, and building robots is just the way to make it more fun.
